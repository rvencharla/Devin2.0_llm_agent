- The user prompts the application with the project requirements and outcomes. 
- The bot divides the tasks into a series of sub-problems. 
- Each of the sub-problem is assigned to separate agents fo solving. 
- A test agent generates test cases for each of the functions generated by the coder agents. 
- If the tests are sucessfull, then the code is pushed to another agents which stitches up multiple pieces of code else, the code is corrected for those generated testcases.
